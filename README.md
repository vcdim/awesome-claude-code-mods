# Awesome Claude Code Mods [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A community list of Claude Code mods (function hooks) for **Claude Code 2.1.287+**. A mod is a plugin that uses JavaScript or TypeScript functions to change Claude Code's interface or behavior. [Browse the catalogue](https://mods.aidojo.si/).

Add a browser beside your conversation, keep usage in view, or check a command before it runs. Install a community mod or [ask Claude to build one](https://claude.dev/blog/getting-started-with-claude-code-mods/#the-shortcut-let-claude-build-it).

This community catalogue scans public GitHub repositories and records what Claude's validator reports each mod can read, write, run or send over the network. It is an independent scan, not an official Anthropic directory.

## Use mods

Use **Claude Code 2.1.287 or later**. Mods are enabled by default; no feature flag is needed. Follow the chosen mod's installation instructions, or try a local plugin with `claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/plugin`.

Read the mod's source and access details before installing. Validation checks the source without running the mod; it does not guarantee safe behavior or runtime compatibility.

- [secret-redactor](https://github.com/ray-amjad/awesome-claude-code-function-hooks/tree/main/plugins/secret-redactor) - Swaps secrets, email addresses and IPs for stable placeholders before the model reads them, and restores them on the way into a tool call.

- [harness-scope](https://github.com/shimo4228/harness-scope) - Per-repo profiles for global skills, agents, rules files and tools: a repo picks a named profile from ~/.claude and Claude sees only what it allows, with no network or model calls.

- [mokkan](https://github.com/vicmpen/mokkan/tree/main/claude-plugin) - `/mokkan` docks a pane of todos and timed reminders beside the transcript, shared with every Claude Code, Codex and terminal session through the mokkan server (api.mokkan.dev), which emails a due reminder nobody acknowledges.
- [agent-compact-advisor](https://github.com/apolenkov/agent-compact-advisor) - A 0-100 score in the status line for how good a moment it is to `/compact`, with a ready `/compact` suggestion past a threshold and a template added to every compaction that keeps the goal, decisions and open leftovers; it never compacts by itself, and its one network call goes to a local Kev endpoint on loopback.

- [explain-as](https://github.com/Sumit189/explain-claude-mod) - `/explain` turns answers into plain ASD-STE100 prose, a Mermaid diagram or an HTML page shown as a zoomable picture in a pane (screenshot by a local headless Chrome), or a narrated canvas explainer video that plays in Chrome.
- [prismantis](https://github.com/NahumLitvin/prismantis) - Redraws Claude's replies in a chosen colour theme, with tables, highlighted code, numbers and paths, GitHub alerts, mermaid diagrams and charts as box art, and right-to-left Hebrew and Arabic.
- [tex-display](https://github.com/samox73/claude-code-latex) - Draws LaTeX display math in Claude's replies as typeset pictures in kitty and Ghostty and as Unicode text elsewhere, with MathJax bundled, so it runs no processes and writes no files.

## Agents and workflows

- [prompt-spellcheck](https://github.com/ljmerza/prompt-spellcheck/tree/main/plugins/prompt-spellcheck) - Uses an extra Haiku call to correct typos before a submitted prompt reaches the model, skips fenced code, and shows changes in a toast, with a `/spellcheck` toggle.
- [next-steps](https://github.com/pawandeepdhall/claude-mods/tree/main/plugins/next-steps) - After each reply, up to six Haiku-generated next steps appear above the prompt; select one or more and press Send to have Haiku compose and submit a combined prompt.
- [agentpane](https://github.com/xuanji86/claude-agentpane) - A side pane of the session's subagents with each one's current tool call and tokens, its conversation drawn in place on a click, and Stop; it opens when an agent starts and folds to a tab when they finish.
- [codex-pane](https://github.com/ManuelWarland/claude-codex-pane) - A `/codex` pane that follows the Codex CLI session you run in another terminal, sends the current exchange to Claude on request, or queues Claude's answer in Codex through `codex queue` after confirmation.
- [gsd-status-mod](https://github.com/helenkwok/gsd-status-mod) - For GSD projects: shows where work stopped and a STATE.md drift warning above the prompt, adds the handoff's next action to the hint line, and offers the command it names as a Tab suggestion.
- [claude-council](https://github.com/danzerzine/claude-council) - A band above the prompt that brings GPT in as fresh eyes on a stuck question, with its answer, Claude's take and GPT's reply pasted into the chat, and can have Codex check every handover against the chat's spec and send gross violations back before the agent answers.

## Every mod the scanner found

The **[full catalogue](catalogue.md#every-mod-the-scanner-found)** includes each discovered mod's description, access, observed events and validation result. [Built-in mods](catalogue.md#built-into-claude-code) are listed separately. [Search and filter the collection on the website](https://mods.aidojo.si/#directory).

## How the scan works

A scheduled scan searches GitHub for mod repositories, checks their plugin source with `claude plugin validate`, and proposes updates for review. The website and catalogue use the same scan data. Published results change when the update PR is merged.

Merging a seed submission also starts a separate publication check. New repositories with passing checks appear automatically after their generated update is merged by the workflow and the website deploys. Existing listings stay unchanged. A seed with validation failures or new review warnings stays unpublished and is reported in the workflow run; other seeds still publish. [Seed publication details](contributing.md#open-a-pull-request).

Discovery depends on GitHub's index and our search patterns, so a new mod may not appear immediately. A scan usually picks up a repository with the `claude-code-mod` topic within a few hours of its next push, and the mod appears once that scan's pull request is merged. [How discovery and validation work](catalogue.md#how-the-scan-works) covers access levels, warnings, retry handling and removal reviews.
